#### If you don't know how to use github, it will be safe to learn first [maybe from here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/).

## How the system will work
1.  You pull the project using **git pull command**.
2.  You first make a branch named **yourinitials-work** e.g mo-design-room stands for mihir okte and work is designing the room.
3.  Then you do your work.
4.  Then you commit your changes, just use the command **commit -am "your commit message"** where your message should be very precise mentioning all changes.
5.  Push your changes after final commits.
6.  Go to Github, go to your branch, then your commits, **open a Pull Request** and assign it to an open issue. Collaborators will open issues aka the tasks after meetings.
7.  Collaborators will review your PR and then merge it with main branch.
8.  Please after you start again with your work, first use the commands **git fetch origin** then **git rebase "Your branch name"** so that your branch is merge error free as well as have all latest headers to other branches.
